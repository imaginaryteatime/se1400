                <h3>Ocean Ruins</h3>
                <p>These sunken cities imply that perhaps the world had flooded at some point. They are fully submerged and loot can be found in them</p>
                <h3>Shipreck</h3>
                <P>Shipwrecks are found at the botton of the ocean with loot in them. We don't know who built them.</P>
                <h3>Ocean Monument</h3>
                <p>Ocean Monuments are inhabited by guardians and elder guardians. They are the only place where sponges can be found and one of the two places where prismarine can be found; the other being ocean ruins</p>
                <p>These might once have been worshipping centers considering the ocean ruins of cities that are also on the bottom of the ocean.</p>
